# Edited Villa Photography — Marbella Collective

## What Was Done

All images have been processed to align better with brand direction:

### Color Adjustments
- **Desaturated by 30%** — reduces bright blues and oversaturation
- **Warmed color temperature** — +5% red channel, -5% blue channel for Mediterranean warmth
- **Reduced contrast by 8%** — softens harsh HDR effect common in real estate photography

### Composition
- **Standardized aspect ratios** — 3:4 portrait for grid consistency, 4:3 for hero images
- **Cropped to 1200px width** — optimized for web performance
- **Subtle vignette** — darkens edges slightly for depth without being obvious

### Quality
- **Film-like softness** — reduced digital sharpness
- **Optimized file size** — 85% JPEG quality, ~30-120KB per image
- **Ready for web** — proper dimensions and compression

## What's Better

✓ Less saturated (blues no longer dominant)
✓ Warmer Mediterranean tones
✓ Softer, less "digital" feel
✓ Consistent aspect ratios
✓ Optimized file sizes
✓ More neutral, less "listing-like"

## What's Still Not Ideal

✗ Staging elements remain (towels, props, decorative items)
✗ Wide-angle distortion in some interiors (can't fix)
✗ Real estate composition (amenity-focused rather than architectural)
✗ Mixed lighting in some shots (natural + artificial)
✗ Still fundamentally "listing photography" not "architectural documentation"

## Recommendation

These edited images are **acceptable for launch** but should be replaced within 6 months with proper architectural photography that:
- Uses natural light only
- Shoots with architectural lenses (minimal distortion)
- Focuses on material, form, and space
- Avoids all lifestyle staging
- Documents rather than sells

## Usage in Website

Place these images as follows:

**Homepage collection grid:** Use exterior shots (villa-exterior-XX.jpg)

**Villa detail hero:** Use best exterior for each property

**Villa gallery:** Mix of outdoor, interior, and material shots (6-9 per villa)

**Avoid:** Don't use bedroom images on homepage — keep those for villa detail pages only
